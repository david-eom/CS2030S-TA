# CS2030S Lab Session Slides

CS2030S Programming Methodology II is the follow-up module to CS1101S Programming Methodology, taught in School of Computing, National University of Singapore. The programming language used is Java, and it explores two modern programming paradigms, object-oriented programming and functional programming.

These are the slides for my lab sessions when I was an undergraduate teaching assistant for the module in AY21/22 Semester 2.
